            Hi! My names is Henry Lin and I am young professional pursing a career in data science and business analytics. I was born in Japan, but raised in Seattle since I was a year old. As a child, grew up speaking Japanese. I've always had a passion for the sciences and baseball.

            For the past few months, I was an Interpreter/Quality Control Intern for the Seattle Mariners. During my time there, I was exposed to the world of analytics and presenting data in a way that is easier to interpret.
